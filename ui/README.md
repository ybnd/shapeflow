# ui

This folder contains everything about the v0.3 user interface.

### Summary & usage

A webapp built on [NuxtJS](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js), based on [NuxtJS + CoreUI boilerplate](https://github.com/muhibbudins/nuxt-coreui), used as the front-end for a [Flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask) app served by [Waitress](https://github.com/Pylons/waitress).

In the `isimple` application the webapp is served locally, directly from compiled files. Therefore you shouldnâ€™t need to worry about anything, hopefully.
