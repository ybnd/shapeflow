### Installation  

0. Install [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (or from the KUL Software Center)

1. Download a deployment script [for the release you want](https://github.com/ybnd/isimple/releases) to the folder you want to install the application in

2. Execute the deployment script (just double-clicking is fine!)

### Usage

0. Run `app.py`.

1. The server will start up and the application should open in a new browser window/tab.

2. After closing this window/tab, the server will shut down automatically. The application's state is saved, so you shouldn't lose any work.

3. If another instance of the server is already running when `app.py` is run, it will be shut down and replaced with a new instance at the same address.

### Troubleshooting

> The application is unresponsive
- The server may have crashed, run `app.py` again.

> The images on the align/filter page don't load properly
- Seek around the video to refresh the images
- Move to a different page and back
- Refresh
