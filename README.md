By providing quantitative insight into the flow dynamics of self-powered microfluidic systems, shapeflow supports research involving the [SIMPLE platform](https://www.biw.kuleuven.be/biosyst/mebios/biosensors-group/research-topics/Microfluidics_folder/simple-platform). The software is developed in collaboration with the [KULeuven Biosensors lab](https://twitter.com/KULBiosensors).
